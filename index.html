    <p id= "firstId" style= "text-anchor: inherit;"> Hello my name is Daniel Liu, and I'm currently enrolled in the CIT-CST Diploma Program. 
        I have been working in the Real Estate industry for <br> the last three years, in my free time I enjoy
        watching the latest NetFlix dramas or skiing. <br> I attended UBC Faculty of sciences in 2011 but 
        dropped out in my third year of university <br> to pursue a career as a poker player and coach for 
        the last 7 years.
